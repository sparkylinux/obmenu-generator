Obmenu Generator

A pipe/static menu generator for the Openbox Window Manager. It is a simple, lightweight, easily configurable Perl script that generates a valid, full, dynamical Openbox xml-menu based upon the information present in *.desktop application files. It generates a static menu with icons as default. Your present menu.xml file will be backuped to menu.xml.bak file.
